        An essay is a common type of academic writing that youll likely be asked
        to do in multiple classes. Before you start writing your essay, make
        sure you understand the details of the assignment so that you know how
        to approach the essay and what your focus should be. Once youve chosen a
        topic, do some research and narrow down the main argument(s) youd like
        to make. From there, youll need to write an outline and flesh out your
        essay, which should consist of an introduction, body, and conclusion.
        After your essay is drafted, spend some time revising it to ensure your
        writing is as strong as possible.
